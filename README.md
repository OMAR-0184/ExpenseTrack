Hey there, fellow coding adventurer! 👋 Welcome to Expenso, my little playground for diving deep into the awesome world of Jetpack Compose and Room Database. It's a learning project where we track expenses, crush bugs, and maybe even find out where all that "missing" money actually went! (Spoiler: probably snacks.)

It's a work in progress, a testament to the fact that even small steps lead to big learning. Expect new features to pop up like surprise bills – but way more fun!

✨ What's Cooking So Far?
Money In, Money Out: Basic tracking of your income and expenses. Because adulting.
The Big Number: A real-time balance so you know if you're rich or just pretending.
Swipe-to-Delete: Gone in a flash! Swiped away a transaction by mistake? Oops! (Just kidding, it's a feature, not a bug... usually.)
Secret Stash (on your phone): All your data lives happily on your device, powered by Room Database. No cloud spying on your late-night pizza habits.
Shiny UI: Built with Jetpack Compose, so it's all smooth animations and less XML pain.
🚀 The Techy Bits (aka "My New Best Friends")
Kotlin: My favorite language for yelling at the compiler (and sometimes getting it to listen).
Jetpack Compose: The reason my UI looks halfway decent.
Room Database: Because even digital money needs a home.
ViewModels & Flow: Keeping things organized so my UI doesn't throw a fit.
Coroutines: For doing stuff in the background without making the app stutter like I do when I see my credit card bill.

🛠️ Get Your Hands Dirty!
Want to peek under the hood or even lend a hand? It's easy!

Clone it: git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Expenso.git
Open it: Fire up Android Studio.
Sync it: Let Gradle do its magic.
Run it: Hit that green play button and watch the magic happen (or debug a crash, it's all part of the learning!).
💡 What's Next? (The To-Do List of Destiny)
This project is a marathon, not a sprint! I'm planning to add:

Graphs & Charts: Because pretty pictures make even sad spending look good.
Budgeting: So we can try to be responsible adults.
Category Management: For those moments when "Miscellaneous" just isn't cutting it anymore.
And much more as I learn!
